***I am sorry, my game was working fine until my computer crashed. Something had gone wrong with my unity files after that. 
The bullets would not go straight and some textures would spontaneously appear and disapear.
I realized afterwards that none of my commits had been going through.
I will work on my laptop and not my surface next time and I will not use the Unity for ARM version next time either.

I tried to fix it but I could not figure it out.***

Something Extra:
I added multiple:
- Red Lava that kills you
- AI navmesh enemies (my first time using navmeshes) that have waypoints but will detect you if you are too close
- A gun that shoots and despawns enemies
- A collision object that when hit, brings you to the next scene
- I used magicavoxel to make 2 different enemy types. I did not add in the second planned enemy because I was trying to figure out the problem from above (the enemy voxel is in the assets folder though).
- Adjusted the player character
- Added a skybox
- A program that ends the game when all stages are completed. I adjusted for the 3rd scene being deleted and added it to the second scene.

3 Levels:
I added 3 levels but the last one was deleted when my computer crashed. The empty scene is still there though.
